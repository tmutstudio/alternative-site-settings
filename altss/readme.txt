This plugin is designed to provide an alternative way to manage website settings.

== Description ==

A plugin for managing website settings, including feedback forms, post duplicator, cookie banners, personalized SEO fields for pages and posts, reviews, and contacts.

The "Alternative Site Settings" plugin was originally conceived as a starter feature set for further development of a single project. As a result, it has been optimized and can be used for small, standard projects, such as landing pages or business cards. Since version 1.2.0, the plugin includes cookie banner functionality.

The plugin includes the following features:

* Editing basic settings, such as the site name and description, meta tags (title and description) for the homepage, og:image for the homepage, copyright information, and additional text fields for the header and footer.
* Editing meta tags (title and description) for pages and posts, and og:image for pages and posts.
* Post duplication functionality.
* Cookie banner with the ability to customize the design and text.
* Connecting Google Tag and Yandex.Metrica analytics scripts based on user selection via the cookie banner.
* Fields for the contact information section, which is typically located at the bottom of the landing page or in the footer. The contact section can also include a map via a third-party plugin shortcode or embed a static image with an office location map.
* Five pre-defined user post types: "News," "Promotions," "Documents," "Books," and "Videos." Each post type is disabled by default.
* Contact forms with a minimum set of seven fields. They meet the basic needs of pop-up feedback forms.
* The "Reviews" section allows you to organize moderated reviews from site visitors.
* Loadable footer section of the website.
* The top admin panel on the frontend can be collapsed to the upper left corner. * Version 1.1.0 adds the ability to completely disable comments on the site.

Attention! The plugin is focused on working with classic themes.

== Changelog ==

= 1.2.0 =
Version 1.2.0 adds a lot of interesting features:
* 1. A fully functional cookie banner with style customization and text editing options has been added. The admin panel also allows you to enable or disable categories of cookies used on the site.
* 2. To make the cookie banner more user-friendly and manageable, analytics scripts for Google Tag and Yandex.Metrica have been added. In the admin panel, you can completely disable each script and choose how to respond to user consent: either not load the script at all if the user declines, or manage its operation via JavaScript.
* 3. An SEO Meta block with the following fields has been added for each blog post, each page, and each post from the list of custom posts the plugin can create: title, description, and og:image. If fields are left blank, they will be generated automatically, and og:image will be replaced with the thumbnail file if one is defined for the record.
* 4. Added functionality for duplicating posts.
* 5. A tab with additional settings has been added for feedback forms. This tab allows you to select the fields that will be saved to the database upon submission. This is necessary due to personal data laws, which are sometimes very strict in some countries.
* 6. The page selection for the privacy policy has been moved from the forms section to the first tab of the settings homepage. A page selection for the cookie policy has also been added there.
* 7. The appearance in the admin panel has been slightly changed.
* 8. Some issues with saving full-text fields have been corrected.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How contact forms are displayed in a theme? =

During plugin activation, the cf-style.tss and cf-script.js files are copied to the “css” and “js” directories located in the “assets” directory of the active theme, respectively. The files do not
overwrite existing files - this is done so that you can set individual styles for forms, unique to each theme. When activating a new theme, the plugin will also have to be activated again.
The display of buttons and forms is carried out either using a shortcode, or by directly registering the buttons in the header file of the theme itself.

Shortcodes:

* [ass_cform_button cfid=1 title="Request a call back"] - Button shortcode
* [ass_cform cfid=1] - Form shortcode

= How are Reviews displayed on the frontend? =

When the plugin is activated, a page type record is created in the posts table with the "reviews" slug and the shortcode [reviews_page] added to the post body.
Also, when activating the plugin, just like in the case of contact forms, the reviews-style.tss and reviews-form.js files are copied to the “css” and “js” directories located in the “assets” directory of the active theme, respectively. Existing files are also not
are overwritten, so you can also set your own review styles unique to each theme. When activating a new theme, the plugin will also have to be activated again.

= How do I insert a button into the policy text to call a cookie banner? =

* To insert a button into the text, the following shortcode is provided:
  [ass_cookie_consent]

* To change the text on the button, the shortcode has a title parameter:
  [ass_cookie_consent title='New text']

= What is this Loadable footer section of the website? =

The footer section allows you to create a ready-made website footer with essential content, such as:
* Company logo,
* Footer menu,
* Copyright,
* Contact form button,
* Block with contact information and map.


= How to include a footer section to the theme? =

You can insert a section into a classic theme using the altss_the_footer_section() function:
<?php if( function_exists( 'altss_the_footer_section' ) ) altss_the_footer_section(); ?>

To insert a footer section into a block theme, you can use the shortcode [ass_footer_section];

Do not forget to check on the checkbox on the first settings tab!



= Does the plugin use its own hooks? =

Yes, the plugin uses its own hooks.
This version has two:
* altss_map_settings_section_show
* altss_admin_after_map_settings_section

Both hooks are used in the admin panel to control the display of settings in the "Data for displaying the map" section in case an additional map plugin needs to be written.
For example, a plugin for connecting the Yandex Maps widget is already available on our GitHub.


= How can a developer use this plugin in his individual project? =

In order to start building their project, the developer simply needs to rename the plugin directory, the main plugin file and the plugin prefix (altss_). Attention! This must be done before activating the plugin.

Also, additional tips and recipes for embedding code into the theme, changing functionality, etc. will be published on the page:
